# Simple Timer App 

Hello there! I am **Brian Alonzo**, a passionate coder who enjoys building cool and useful stuff. Welcome to the repository of my simple Java-based timer application.

The timer app is a GUI application built using Java Swing that allows users to start and stop a timer. The elapsed time in seconds is displayed in real-time. 

## Features
- Start/Stop timer functionality
- Real-time display of elapsed seconds
- User-friendly GUI

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved `TimerApp.java`.
3. Compile the program using the Java compiler `javac`:

```bash
javac TimerApp.java
```

This will create a file named `TimerApp.class` in the same directory.

4. Run the compiled program using the Java interpreter:

```bash
java TimerApp
```

You should now see a new window appearing with the title "Timer App", and it will contain a start/stop button and a label displaying the elapsed time in seconds.
